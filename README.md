# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a project I made for the Geographical Networks, Structure, Analysis and Performances class at the University of Salerno.
The work required the use of the Twitter API to collect italian tweets on the "Immuni" mobile application. 
After collecting the tweets, they have been translated to the english language, so that they could be prepared for the usage of VADER.
The translation has been done with the Azure translation service, whilst VADER has produced a score on the positivity of the sentiment.
A filter has been applied to measure the positivity or negativity of the translated tweet.
Python is the programming language used for the project.
